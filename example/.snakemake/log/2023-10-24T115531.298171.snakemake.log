MissingOutputException in rule python_output in file /home/niko/github/nsiccha/snakemakeutils/example/snakefile, line 6:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/python.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
