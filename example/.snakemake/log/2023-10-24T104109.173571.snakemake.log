Error in rule lint:
    jobid: 1
    output: output/lint.log
    shell:
        snakemake --lint > output/lint.log
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job lint since they might be corrupted:
output/lint.log
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
